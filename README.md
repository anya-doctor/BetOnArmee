# BetOnArmee

### A betting System implemented in C++ as a final project for the class of Object Oriented Programming.

The system's information (registered users, bet hierarchy, ongoing bets, history, profit) is saved on disk files. The program can be run each time a registered user (who must log in) or a guest desires to explore (for everyone), bet on (for Punters) or modify (for Traders and Directors) the system's bet hierarchy, a tree of categories and subcategories leading to events, that Punters can bet on for a designated (by the Traders) stake.

The assignment's full description as well as a readme for our implementation can be found (in Greek) in `OOP2016.pdf` and `README.pdf` respectively.
